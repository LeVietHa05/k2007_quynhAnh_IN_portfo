The main shopping street was vibrant and bustling with every store showcasing a dazzling array of merchandise. Groups of tourists popped in and out of boutiques, some beaming with pride in fresh silk garments. The vivacity of female visitors, born fashion enthusiasts, infused the street with life. Their infectious cheerfulness was a balm for my heart, as I had been feeling out of place with my school uniform and a camera slung on my neck. "

This time, I had the chance to talk to the artisans, who revealed to me that the jacquard looms from Mr. Triệu Văn Mão’s workshop were hundreds of years old or that creating a new weaving pattern entailed meticulous geometric calculations (the process of transferring a design onto the punch cards scrunched me up more than logarithms and limits). However, nothing could compare with a comprehensive how-to of silk production from a seasoned weaver from Mr. Mão's workshop, whose voice magically glided through the drowning noise of three looms in full force and guided me through the process from start to finish.`

Mulberry trees, carefully cultivated, provide sustenance for the industrious silkworms, whose health directly influences the silk's quality. Skilled artisans extract the delicate silk threads from the cocoons through a process called reeling, a task that, while now aided by modern machinery, still requires a human touch to ensure the silk's integrity. The threads are then straightened, wound onto spools, and shipped to workshops for weaving. <br>The next process - weaving - is a marvel of precision and artistry. The threads are meticulously arranged on the loom, their interlacing forming intricate patterns that define Vạn Phúc silk. Dyeing adds a vibrant palette to the fabric, a process that involves careful purification and precise measurements to achieve the desired hues. After washing and drying, the silk is ready to be showcased, made into products, or sold to discerning customers. From the cultivation of mulberry trees to the intricate processes of reeling, weaving, and dyeing, each step contributes to the creation of truly exquisite silk. `

Afterward, I wandered through a variety of shops, from opulent boutiques to more laid-back stores, only to sense that I wasn’t exactly welcome. As I caught sight of my reflection in a nearby mirror, however, I realized that my mask, hat, and oversized bag seemed to mark me as a potential mischief-maker. <br> To shake off the feeling, I made a beeline to the small food stall opposite the Vạn Phúc Shrine, my stomach reminding me it was already noon. Indulging in a toothsome cup of homemade chè thập cẩm and scrumptious bánh rán, accompanied by sweet and sour fish sauce while watching the woman round tapioca pearls, I couldn’t help but smile. It was genuinely uplifting to see such a vibrant and thriving Vạn Phúc, despite the existing challenges of cultural identity, economic development, and heritage preservation.`
