            "Giang Cao Village was honeyed in sun rays and humid air from an earlier cloudburst. Squeezing a roaring metal beast - my motorbike -  through its narrow, snaky alleys, I followed the guide of an acquaintance to one of the oldest pottery-making houses in the village. After riding past a few wooden doors with tiled roofs in Imperial architecture style, which opened to, unexpectedly, roads instead of houses, we finally arrived at a production site carefully tucked away in a street corner, whose security is kept by tiny but fierce canine guards.",
            `Giang Cao Village and Bát Tràng Village comprise the Bát Tràng commune, the birthplace of Vietnam’s finest ceramic and pottery products. From the inception of pottery-making craft in this area, Giang Cao potters were mainly laborers for Bát Tràng workshops until the first workshop was set up here in the 19th century,  Since then, artisans from Giang Cao have developed their hometown into a thriving ceramic industry, with unique techniques and niche products that set itself apart from the well-established neighbor.`,
            `Ceramics from Giang Cao are infused with the dynamism and creativity of a young craft village. Shifting from Bát Tràng village’s focus on preserving traditions, Giang Cao craftsmanship caters to popular culture and is more tailored towards meeting commercial demands. According to the artisans, architectural ceramics such as decorative tiles,  mural arts, and tailor-made ceramic ware are the signature products of Giang Cao’s pottery-making.`, `Giang Cao village’s innovative and artistic essence is infused in its architecture and people. Narrow, snaky alleys and centuries-old or modern public buildings are adorned with creative ceramic mosaics or traditional yin-yang tiles. Along the main streets, ceramics showrooms with glass windows display a rich variety of products, from manufactured household items to handmade high-end ceramics for religious purposes, turning a part of Giang Cao into a bustling commercial street, a bold stroke of modernism on an antique canvas that many associate with a traditional craft village. `,
            `Mrs. Nga Tươi’’s pottery workshop lies in the quieter part of Giang Cao village, at the end of a hilly alley, cunningly eluding the footsteps of tourists. From the stone gate, ceramic vases of various sizes and designs stacked on top of each other lined the porch, leaving only a one-person-wide passage into the house; their excellence tested in Hanoi’s humid air and scorching sunbath.`,
            `Inside the workshop, brick - red pottery freshly out of the oven occupied the place - throngs of pilgrims hardened by inferno’s fire - awaiting decoration.Rows of molds took up the remaining space, ready to breathe artistic and practical values into liquified clay.`,
            `Mrs.Nga’s workshop is a make - to - order business, using hand - crafted molds for mass production.`,
            `The birth of a ceramic product starts with preparing the clay.Clay is imported from mines in minerals - rich areas in Vietnam and some East Asian countries.Each type of clay, differing in color, purity, and malleability, caters to specific lines of product, with the purest clay being used for luxury ceramics.`,
            ` Clay, after being treated to the desired quality, is softened with water and then poured into molds.After the product has taken shape, it is removed from the mold and touched up before being glazed.From this step, the process of making ceramics can be likened to nail tech.The artisans create unique mixes of glazes to produce colors and patterns particular to each design.Glazed ceramics after being air - dried await further decoration or go into the firing process.`,
            `The firing process often takes 4-6 days, with 2-3 days of fire and the rest for cooling. The cooling period requires a seasoned craftsman, as temperature shock will result in cracks and fractures. At the time of my visit, the workshop’s kiln was in its cooling break, having been on fire for 3 days to produce a batch of planters.`,
            `The workshop, according to Mrs.Nga, has been there since the inception of Giang Cao’s ceramics industry, and pottery making has been the livelihood of her family for generations.But that is unlikely to be true for much longer.`,
            `“You should do something else if you can.Why ceramics ? Go to university and get a paying job!”, she said before hurrying to check a batch of products in their molds.`,
            `Left to our own devices, we wandered around the workshop. The concrete two-storeyed building, with steel extensions for storing products, is where her family has lived and worked for over half a century. Their life is interwoven in the workshop, with clotheslines hanging over empty parts of the floor, children’s toys scattering around bisque-ware, and household items gathered in various corners.`,
            `We came across an artisan painting underglazes on oval bonsai pots. Under his brushstrokes, scenes of magnificent nature and peaceful rural lives appeared in cobalt blue, echoing the rich ceramic history of centuries past. His mastery was honed since childhood when he learned the craft of painting ceramics from his father. Sitting next to him was another artisan, resting with a kettle of green tea and some cigarettes; a shiny golden wireless karaoke microphone standing in juxtaposition with terracotta vessels.`,
            `“So are you doing ceramics?”, he asked.`,
            `Before we could find the words, the drawing artisan had responded:`,
            `“No, they’re just here for… research, right?”, he paused to dip his brush. And then,`,
            `“It’s hard to live by ceramics, kids. You should study and get a degree -  Go for banking!”`,
            `They burst out laughing, while we were turning red.`,
            `“Yeah, go for that teller job that lets you keep however much money you can count! Today you count a billion, you earn a billion! ”, the other said, pouring a cup of tea for his co-worker, who had left the magnificent mountain range treeless to light a cigarette.`,
            `“My daughter wants to study banking, too”, he told us, before his deep inhale of smoke stretched a thin silence in the room, the moment at which we said goodbye to the artisans, retreating to our familiar third-person viewpoint with a chest full of tobacco smoke and phantom questions.`,
            `“So, they don’t want their children to do ceramics?”`,
            `Ambivalence towards the inheritance of the craft also echoed in our conversations with Ms. Nga and other people working in the craft. From low-paid workers to successful artisans, no one seems to want their children to become “potters” or “ceramicists”. These terms are, after all, hardly ever enlisted in the vocabulary for “Jobs”, let alone in “25 Best-Paying Careers”.`,
            `In this day and age, when mass production and automation are revolutionizing the pottery-making industry, churning out quality and trendy products at an ever-lower price, many artisans saw themselves becoming factory workers. Compounded by fierce competition from imported products and declining demand, ceramics yield little profits for the average craftsman. Yet, apart from wealthy people seeking exquisite items, who goes to a craft village to buy something? A combo of dwindling status and meager pay is driving away prospective ceramicists while disheartening present-day artisans, casting a gloom over the future of Giang Cao and Bát Tràng village. If seasoned workers are reluctant to pass down the craft to their children, who will keep it alive?`,
            `Our society takes pride in the rich cultural heritages upheld throughout centuries of assimilation, colonization, and war; we want to preserve them for generations to come. But who is doing the work of preservation? Tourism certainly gives a new lease of leaf to traditional craft villages, turning them into profitable tourists’ “must-sees”, but it fails to generate a dependable source of additional income for every pottery maker. And when they cannot live by doing ceramics alone, there is no choice but to find a different job.`,
            `Next to Mrs. Nga’s workshop is another one owned by 3 brothers. They specialize in decorative ceramics.`,
            `While YouTube videos were filling the soft silence of a workshop at rest and the sky was turning persimmon orange as the Sun set, we were wide-eyed at the vibrant ceramic tile murals on the floor. The young artist had just finished coloring the pieces and was waiting for the paints to dry. As he checked the pieces, he told us about his specialty - making ceramic murals - with such ease as if it was no more sophisticated to him than clay play is to children. And, between his words, we recognized an artisan driven by genuine passion. He belonged to the next generation of Giang Cao ceramicists, maturing in a period fraught with uncertainties and erratic changes. But as long as the kiln is lit, the craft lives on, right?`,
            `The final destination of our journey is the Giang Cao temple. The last sun rays withdrew; we waved goodbye to the Bát Tràng commune, now more than just a name on the map to both of us.`,
